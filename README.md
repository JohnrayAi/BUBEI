💖 To My Bubbeii 💖

Welcome to a little corner of the internet I made just for **you**, my love.  
This is more than just a webpage — it's a digital love letter, a memory box, and a date invitation, all wrapped up in one. 🌹

🌸 What's Inside
- 📸 **Our Memories** — A gallery of moments that make my heart smile.
- 💌 **A Love Letter** — Words from my heart to yours.
- 📅 **Date Invitation** — Because every moment with you is worth planning for.

💞 Our First Anniversary
Today marks **1 year** since this beautiful journey began.  
From laughs and late-night talks to warm hugs and shared dreams — thank you for being my everything.  
I made this web just to say:

> _"I love you, bubbeii — always, endlessly, and more than words can say."_ 💘

> _This project isn’t just code. It’s a piece of my heart — for the person who holds it._  
> With all my love,  
> **Your [Name or Nickname]**
